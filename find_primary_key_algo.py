# algorithm for find a primary key
# so the algorithm will list all the available field in a collection
# and then deterimine if a field or a combination of a fields can 
# uniquely identify the data
# TODO: program to count or determine the value of uniqueness of a field
# or a combination of a field

# field or combination of a fields that can unqiuely identify the data
# will be count as a candidate key
# primary key will be chosen from the candidate key
# primary key will be the shortest candidate key and also appear on other collection
